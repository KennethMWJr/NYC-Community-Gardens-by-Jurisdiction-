# NYC-Community-Gardens-by-Jurisdiction-
Using SODA API from NYC Open Data, discover the jurisdiction of any community garden registered with NYC Parks, GreenThumb.

# Project Overview

Groups of volunteers in NYC manage community gardens on property with different jurisdicitions - aka ownership. Each jurisdiction has it's own set of policies/agreements setting the parameters for how these groups should interact with the land they use for community gardening purposes. In this project the user will enter a zipcode in NYC and receive the community gardens and jurisdiction in that region. 

## Project Description

In this project I accessed NYC's public data on community gardens registered with NYC Parks,GreenThumb to identify the jurisdiction of any registered community garden in NYC by zipcode.  

The main goal is to inform community gardeners along with garden supporters of a community garden's jurisdiction and provide information on what that means for how that commuity garden should function. I would like to develop a way for anyone (i.e. individuals, agencies, CBOs, etc.) to provide more information related to community gardens in regard to jurisdictions. The purpose of that would be to ensure information on each jurisdiction and community gardens by zipcode are up to date.

Future goals: add a map displaying zipcode and gardens in the selected region.
